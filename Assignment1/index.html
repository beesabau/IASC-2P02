          <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
          <p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>

            <p>Shadows often seem alive in the night, when one is alone and their reason wanders. After a certain point, those living shadows begin to feel like company. The cave dwellers had grown accustomed to the face by now. It watched them silently, smiling — in approval? It took an uncertain, as the dwellers had no outside concept of time, but presumably great while before it <span class="clickable" id="first-change">began moving</span>. What had been a permanent smile now rotated. The dwellers lacked the knowledge of its cause, but were convinced of its power. When the face smiled, they believed it bestowed its blessing. When it frowned, they perceived it as a danger and as punishment. The dwellers soon began to develop rituals to appease the face, believing that their survival depended on its favour. One day, (or perhaps night? They certainly did not know.), as the dwellers stared at their patron? God?, <span class="clickable" id="second-change">its eyes widened</span>. A new expression. A new message? Were they meant to understand? It had been watching them the entire time, they thought. This must have meant that the face grew more critical, that perhaps one of them had done something wrong and brought on its harsher judgement. They were not doing enough to satisfy it, clearly.</span></p>

            <p>The idea of “flatness,” as per Sousanis's Unflattening, is a way of seeing the world that is minimal and controlled. Those who exist in “flatness” do not see beyond their immediate surroundings. Their reality is built for them and they simply accept it. In the context of the cave dwellers, “flatness” is represented in their limited understanding of the shadow face and its expressions. They believe that the face controls their fate, and that their survival depends on placating it. Their thoughts and actions revolve around the face; it is all they know, and that traps them in a cycle of repetition. The narrowing of their lives’ purposes prevents the dwellers from realizing that their survival and their future are not in the hands of the face. They are bound by the constraints of a world that has been designed for them by both their environment (i.e., the face) and their own inability to imagine anything beyond what they’ve always known. The dwellers passively accept their circumstance and build their lives around their situation because they do not know any different.</p>

          <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
          <p><span class="clickable" id="part-two">From outside the cave...</span></p>

            <p>Outside of the cave, the face looks… different. It's no longer a deity. No longer a force to be revered or feared. In the open air and the light, it's nothing more than a collection of shapes. Three-dimensional and devoid of meaning. The mouth that controlled their actions is just a curve, and the eyes that cast judgment down on them are nothing more than empty spheres. To any onlookers, there is no god here. The face, in its true form, is nothing more than a group of objects that has no more purpose than any other feature of the landscape. Anyone who steps outside the cave would see it from all sides, and in that view, the face would lose its grip on their minds, thereby releasing its hold over their thoughts and actions. The truth, they would realize, can not be found in the singular, static image they had held in their minds, but in the varying perspectives of the real world. <span class="clickable" id="third-change">Disrupting the shapes</span> could shatter the illusion, right? Maybe. But is there anyone who could, when the cave dwellers are so preoccupied with their survival? What if somebody were to come and
            <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change"> take the shapes entirely</span>? Would that snap the dwellers out of their routine? Left with nothing, would they feel encouraged to step outside?</span></p>

            <p>Where “flatness” is the inability or refusal to see options and possibilities, the idea of “seeing double” is the act of viewing something from multiple perspectives and recognizing that the truth of an idea or situation cannot be fully grasped by only looking at it from one single, fixed view. To paraphrase what was stated in class: truth emerges from the combination of different views. In the case of the cave dwellers, their limited, 2D perspective on the face keeps them trapped in a simple understanding of it. They perceive it as an all-powerful entity, but outside the cave, the face is shown to be what it truly is, and what it truly is is just a collection of 3D objects with no inherent meaning attached to them. Only by seeing it from different angles and understanding its form as something detached from the idea of the divine can the dwellers — or anyone, really — realize its insignificance. Comparative to its deification, anyway. When they are finally able to step outside their limited view (literally, the cave itself), something that does not happen in the story (yet!), they begin to see that the face has no power beyond what they have imagined. Through “seeing double,” they can break free from their narrow perception and understand that reality is not as fixed or as determined as they think.</p>
